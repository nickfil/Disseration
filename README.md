Approximate Consistent Query Answering algorithm

Implementing and testing the algorithm for consistent query answering in inconsistent databases suggested by Callautti, Libkin and Pieris in their paper "An Operational Approach to Consistent Query Answering" (2018) - https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/libkin/papers/pods18a.pdf

The repository also includes a Random Query Generator given a database schema.

In this project I have experimented with connecting Java to PostgreSQL, as well as parallel processing with multithreading.

Also please add this repository to your build path https://github.com/kostaskougios/cloning. It is used in the CQA algorithm.
